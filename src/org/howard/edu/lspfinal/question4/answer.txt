Answer: In lecture we discussed that if we give every Duck a fly() method by inheritance, we would have to override fly() in RubberDuck to do nothing, since rubber ducks cannot fly. If there were to be more non-flying duck classes, you must override fly() in each one of them. This makes the code extra hard to read, requires more maintenance, and is overengineered for such a simple task. In this situation, it would be better to only put fly() in the Duck subclasses that actually can fly. This makes the design simple.
